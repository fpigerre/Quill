Quill
=====

Quill is a modern, simplistic user interface, designed to be used as a front-end for writing texts.

Quill uses the following fonts:
* Lato       - Weights 100, 300, 400 and 700
* Exo        - Weight 400
* Montserrat - Weight 400

Quill uses [Squire](http://neilj.github.io/Squire/) to implement text-editing utilities.
